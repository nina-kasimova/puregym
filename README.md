## A brief overlook
I had a quick look at the data I've collected and I found the heatmap below summarises it pretty well. It's actually helpful for planning my week and knowing when I can count to be able to go to the gym. 
For example, as expected Monday evening is a bad choice but it calms down by Thursday and you should be fine 7pm onwards. </br>
There's some missing data around midnight until 2am because the backend doesn't return the number of people if it's lower than 10, so for now I replaced missing numbers with 10
